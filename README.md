# Exporting your JSON data into CSV format with Papa Parse

The aim of this repo is to illustrate how you can pull out information from your MongoDB into a CSV format well suited for integration with 3rd-party libraries.

A detailed tutorial can be read at my [personal blog](http://rafaelquintanilha.com/export-your-json-data-to-csv-format/) where any feedback is extremely appreciated. Check the [online demo](http://json-to-csv.meteor.com/) as well to see what you are building.

Please note this is an experimental repo and I am more than willing to listen any kind of improvements that could be made.
